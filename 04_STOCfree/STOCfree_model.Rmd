# Context

---
## Context

- Disease control programmes when the disease is still present

--

- Objectives:

 - identify infected herds

 - protect uninfected herds from infection within the programme
 
 - reassure trading partners from outside the programme
 
--

- Aim of the model:

 - estimate a probability of freedom from infection for all herds in the programme incorporating all the available information
 
---
## Modelling framework

- Model outcome: herd-level probability of being positive in the most recent month for which surveillance data are available

--

- Input data:

 - test results
 
 - risk factors
 
--

- Hidden Markov Model:

 - latent status
 
 - monthly dynamics

--

- Bayesian inference:

 - requires priors
 
 - modelling in Stan (or JAGS)
